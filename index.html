                        Hurricane Willa was a powerful tropical cyclone that brought torrential rains and destructive
                        winds
                        to
                        the Mexican states of Sinaloa and Nayarit in October 2018. It was the twenty-second named storm,
                        thirteenth hurricane, and tenth major hurricane of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season, and tied a
                        record
                        as that season's third Category 5 hurricane. Willa originated from a tropical wave in the
                        southwestern
                        Caribbean Sea that crossed over Central America into the East Pacific without significant
                        organization.
                        On October 20 the system developed into a tropical depression, and strengthened later in the day
                        into
                        Tropical Storm Willa. It peaked as a Category 5 hurricane with sustained winds of 160 mph (260
                        km/h)
                        two
                        days later. On October 24, Willa made landfall in Sinaloa as a marginal Category 3 hurricane. It
                        killed
                        nine people, and caused more than Mex$16 billion (US$820 million) in damage. (This article is
